# Sentiment Sorting 
For the merge script, input a list of csv files where the columns are 'Name' and 'Purpose'. The csv files you input will output as one csv file that is a combination of all the files inputted. Make sure the csv files are on the same directory as this script. 
For the sentiment script, input a dataframe that has a column called 'Purpose'. This input will output the most positive and negative company purposes using vader sentiment. It is easier to use merge(l) as the dataframe input. 
For the common script, input a dataframe that has a column called 'Purpose'. This input will output the ten most common words in all the company purposes, along with the frequency the word was used. It is easier to use merge(l) as the dataframe input. 
For simplicity and to see my results, type main() into the console and the most positive and negative company purposes will be the output along with the 10 most common words in the csv company purpose csv file.
